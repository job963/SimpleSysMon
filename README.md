# Piwik Simple System Monitor Plugin

## Description

This plugin shows how much load your webserver does have, where Piwik (and maybe your main website) is running. Additionally the free or the used memory will be displayed.

The display will be refreshed automatically as often as you like. This can be setup by yourself in the plugin settings.
